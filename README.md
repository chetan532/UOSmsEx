<h2>Send OTP to specific number using OTP Placer </h2>

Experience the power of modern Android app development with our feature-rich application, built using cutting-edge libraries such as Dagger, Coroutines, and MVVM architecture. This app is designed to simplify the process of sending text messages with OTP (One-Time Password) functionality, while also providing seamless storage of SMS data using the Room Database.

With our app, sending text messages with OTP has never been easier. Leveraging the Dagger library, the app ensures efficient dependency injection, allowing for a modular and maintainable codebase. The Coroutines library enables smooth and responsive handling of asynchronous operations, ensuring a seamless user experience when generating and sending OTP messages.

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a scalable code structure. The Model layer interacts with the OTP Placer Library, seamlessly generating and formatting OTP messages. The ViewModel layer efficiently manages the data and business logic, providing the necessary information to the View layer for display.

In addition to sending OTP messages, our app offers a robust and secure storage solution for SMS data. Leveraging the power of the Room Database library, the app enables seamless and reliable storage of incoming and outgoing SMS messages. This ensures that important messages are not lost and can be accessed at any time.

The app's user interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Users can effortlessly enter the recipient's phone number, along with the desired message content, and the app takes care of generating and sending the OTP message automatically. The user can also view the history of sent and received SMS messages, with the ability to search and filter based on specific criteria.

Your data privacy is of utmost importance to us. The app securely stores SMS data using the Room Database, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. We adhere to industry-standard encryption practices and employ robust security measures to safeguard your data.
